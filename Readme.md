# BASIC MICROSERVICES VIA GOLANG

In this study, I will try to introduce the simplest web-based microservice using the Golang programming language. Intermediate level knowledge of Golang language will be sufficient.

> ## Working environment
>
> - Debian Operating System
> - Golang sw language

## Whats is basic definition of microservices ?
Microservices are self-running applications that perform certain functions and special operations.
Java, Python, and Go are the languages that are easy to maintain and update, which is essential for building a microservice.The world's largest technology companies such as Amazon, Netflix, and Uber also use microservice structures.

## Restful API
The method is the type of request you send to the server. The four main resource methods that are associated with REST APIs are:

> - GET: This method allows for the server to find the data you requested and sends it back to you.
> - PUT: If you perform the ‘PUT’ request, then the server will update an entry in the database.
> - POST: This method permits the server to create a new entry in the database.
> - DELETE: This method allows the server to delete an entry in the database.
